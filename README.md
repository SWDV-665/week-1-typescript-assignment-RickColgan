## Grocery
This file is a typescript file used for an introductory assignment to start a grocery list.

The hardest part about creating this file was figuring out how to prevent the typescript from writing over itself when it went
through the for-loop. It wasn't until I discovered that I could take document.body.innerHTML and add it to itself each time in
the for-loop that I finally got it to work.

## Questions from Assignment Submission Page
#### How many hours to complete assignment?
It took about two hours to update my copy of Visual Studio 2017 (but I still couldn't get it to
work) so  I ended up using Visual Studio Code. Writing the code took about 30 minutes to get it to work except for the last line
problem (see above). Getting the lines to properly print took about an hour.

#### What was the easiest part for completing the assignment?
The general code was pretty easy. I don't do a lot of coding in JavaScript or TypeScript, but I'm literate enough to know how they work
and what parts of them do. Those parts that I don't know, I end up using Google and StackOverflow to look for ideas and suggestions.
The easiest "easiest" part was setting VSC to automatically compile the TS code whenever it was saved.

#### What was the most difficult challenge for completing the assignment?
I don't understand how classes work in TypeScript. They're not object-oriented in the same manner that a class would be in Python or C++.
To get the program to work, I left out the class part and just used the interface. The interface is the class definition that I am
more familiar with. The class definition was added after I had the TS working. When I added it, there didn't seem to be a difference in
how it went.
